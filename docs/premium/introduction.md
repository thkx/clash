# Introduction

In the past, there was only one open-source version of Clash, until some [improper uses and redistributions](https://github.com/hhhhhhhxx/clash/issues/541#issuecomment-672029110) of Clash arose. From that, we decided to fork Clash and develop the more advanced features in a private GitHub repository.

Don't worry just yet - the Premium core will stay free of charge, and the security is enforced with peer reviews from multiple credible developers.

## What's the difference?

The Premium core is a fork of the open-source Clash core with the addition of the following features:

- [TUN Device](./tun-device.md) with the support of `auto-redir` and `auto-route`
- [eBPF Redirect to TUN](./ebpf.md)
- [Rule Providers](./rule-providers.md)
- [Script](./script.md)
- [Script Shortcuts](./script-shortcuts.md)
- [Userspace Wireguard](./userspace-wireguard.md)
- [The Profiling Engine](./the-profiling-engine.md)

## Obtaining a Copy

You can download the latest Clash Premium binaries from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/hhhhhhhxx/clash/releases/tag/premium).
